Abstract:

Data for fish lengths and weights were taken from eleven primary North temperate lakes (including Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, Trout, bog lakes, Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Fish). The sampling method was in six zones per lake with several types of traps. The species were then identified and the measurements taken.

## Sharing and Accessing Information

The data used in this project is released under the Creative Commons license, required to cite the data appropriately in any publication that results from its use. More relevant information can be found [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-ntl.6.34). Data was downloaded through the EDI Data Portal.

## Methodological Information

Collecting the data followed the following methodological approach: on each lake there were six littoral zones with siene, minnow, or crayfis traps, and fyke nets. Vertically hung gill nets were used to obtain two pelagic samples per lake form the deepest point. A trammel net samples across the thermocline at two sites per lake. In the bog lakes only fyke nets and minnow traps were used. Parameters measured include species-level identification and lengths for all fish caught, and weight and scale samples from a subset.

Once the data was collected, the data was posted for use "as-is".
